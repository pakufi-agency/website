This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, build on top of [Maxdi theme](https://themeforest.net/item/maxdi-creative-agency-react-nextjs-template/39002986?s_rank=1).
The project is bootstrapped with

- [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
- React Bootstrap
- Google Fonts
- Swiper Slider
- Font Awesome + Flaticon

It built with:

- Typescript
- Eslint

## Getting Started

- Be sure to have at least `node v.18+`and `TypeScript v4.5.2` to get syntax features
- Go in the project directory and install the npm packages:

```bash
npm i
```

- Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- To run the production server run:

```bash
npm start
```

- Have a look at the script section of the `package.json` to learn which other useful scripts you can run.

## Good to know

- `next-env.d.ts.` is autogenerated so do not edit it. If you need to eclare custom type use `custom-types.d.ts`

## Useful tools

### VS Code Nextjs-Typescript plugin:

Next.js includes a [custom TypeScript plugin](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#typescript-plugin) and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.

You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:

    Opening the command palette (Ctrl/âŒ˜ + Shift + P)
    Searching for "TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version"
    Selecting "Use Workspace Version"

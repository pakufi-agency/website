This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), build on top of [StartP theme](https://themeforest.net/item/startp-react-next-it-solutions-software-and-saas-template/23634564).
The project is bootstrapped with

- [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
- Nextjs
- Typescript
- Bootstrap
- Sass
- Dynamic Contact Form
- Stripe

## Getting Started

- Be sure to have at least `node v.18+`and `TypeScript v4.5.2` to get syntax features
- Go in the project directory and install the npm packages:

```bash
npm i
```

- Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- To run the production server run:

```bash
npm start
```

- Have a look at the script section of the `package.json` to learn which other useful scripts you can run.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Good to know

- `next-env.d.ts.` is autogenerated so do not edit it. If you need to eclare custom type use `custom-types.d.ts`

## Useful tools

### VS Code Nextjs-Typescript plugin:

Next.js includes a [custom TypeScript plugin](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#typescript-plugin) and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.

You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:

    Opening the command palette (Ctrl/âŒ˜ + Shift + P)
    Searching for "TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version"
    Selecting "Use Workspace Version"
